## Description of the project

This is a pet project that I made to practice with html and css. I used sass preprocessor to compile styles to style.css, used media queries for adaptive layout,
experimented with sass variables, added fonts, used video for background, applied css animations, used css quality clip-path to reshape images, css mixins. I have done
the form with input validation. The website was built with Float. 

This project is better viewed with VS Code (plagins: Live Server, Live Sass Compiler).
